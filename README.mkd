droid.vim
=========

A few utilities such as quick access to resources, templates, and an emulator
interface.

This was inspired by tpope's [rails.vim]() and some of the code was also
borrowed from there. Thanks tpope.

TODO
-----

* Implement DroidListAvds, 
            DroidRunAvd (with completion)
* Add make/ant support
* Omnicomplete
